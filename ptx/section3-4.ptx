    <title>Problem 2</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        At which of the labeled points, if any,
        are both <m>\dfrac{dy}{dx}</m> and
        <m>\dfrac{d^2y}{dx^2}</m> positive? <image width="37%" source="images/" />
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        The only point where they are both positive is <m>B</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here's the proof.
        Recall that <m>\deriv{y}{x}</m> is positive when the slope is positive,
        and this means the graph is increasing.
        The points <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> are the only points where the slope is positive,
        and so we can cross off all the other points from our answer:
        cross off <m>A</m>, <m>D</m>, and <m>E</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next, recall that <m>\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}</m> is positive where the graph is concave up,
        which means it must have a shape roughly like
      </p>
      <image>
        <latex-image><![CDATA[\begin{tikzpicture}[very thick,baseline=0.35cm]
        \draw (0,0) arc (280:350:1);\end{tikzpicture}]]></latex-image>
      </image>
      <p>
        or
      </p>
      <image>
        <latex-image><![CDATA[\begin{tikzpicture}[very thick,baseline=-0.5cm]
        \draw (0,0) arc (190:260:1);\end{tikzpicture}]]></latex-image>
      </image>
      <p>
        So, the only points where
        <m>\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}</m> is positive are at <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.

              Since this graph is increasing,

              Since this graph is curving upwards,
              we have <m>f''(x)</m> is positive. (Remember: Concave up is part of a cup.)

        <ol>
          <li>

          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <q>The price of the stock is getting close to its peak,
              at which it will remain for a little while.</q>
            </p>

          <li>

            <p>
              The phrase <q>price <ellipsis /> is falling</q> means <m>P'(t) \lt 0</m>.
              Now you can draw three kinds of falling graphs:
              <image> <latex-image><![CDATA[\begin{tikzpicture}[very thick,baseline=-0.5cm] \draw[scale=0.9] (0,0) -- (1,-1);\end{tikzpicture}]]></latex-image> </image> or \DecreaseConcaveDown or <image> <latex-image><![CDATA[\begin{tikzpicture}[very thick,baseline=-0.5cm] \draw (0,0) arc (190:260:1);\end{tikzpicture}]]></latex-image> </image> Which of these do you think makes the most sense for
              <q>faster and faster.</q> Probably the middle one.
              In that case,
              it's concave down (<q>concave down is part of a frown</q>) and so <m>P''(t) \lt 0</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              For the price to be getting close to its peak,
              we need that the graph is increasing,
              so <m>P'(t) > 0</m>, and starting to level out a little bit,
              so curving like this \IncreaseConcaveDown That means that it's concave down,
              so <m>P''(t)\lt 0</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              The price skyrocketing means that it is increasing,
        so <m>P'(t) > 0</m>.
              Also,
        it's probably not increasing more slowly as time goes on,
              so it's <em>not</em> \IncreaseConcaveDown.
              Rather, it probably looks like this:
              <image> <latex-image><![CDATA[\begin{tikzpicture}[very thick,baseline=0.35cm] \draw (0,0) arc (280:350:1);\end{tikzpicture}]]></latex-image> </image> This means that it is concave up (<q>Concave up is part of a cup</q>) and so <m>P''(0)>0</m>.

          </li>
        </ol>
