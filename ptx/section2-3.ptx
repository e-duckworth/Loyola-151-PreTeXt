            Find the change in bicycle production between 1950 and 2000.
            Give units.

        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Find the average rate of change in bicycle production between 1950 and 2000.
            Give units and interpret your answer in terms of bicycle production.

        <ol>

            <p>
              We simply subtract the bicycle production during one year from
              the production during another year:
              <me>
                101-11 = 90
              </me>
              The units are <q>million bicycles</q>,
              so the full answer is 90 million
              bicycles.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              The average rate of change is, by definition,
              <me>
                \frac{\text{ change in \(y\)-values } }{\text{ change in \(x\)-values } }
              </me>
              In this case that means
              <me>
                \dfrac{90}{50} = \frac{9}{5} = \frac{18}{10} = \unitfrac[1.8]{Million\ Bicycles}{Year}
              </me>
              where the units are million bicycles per year.

              The interpretation is this:
              from 1950 to 2000, production of bicycles
              increased on average <m>1.8</m> million bicycles per year.

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Find the average rate of change of
        <m>f(x) = 4x^2-2</m> between <m>x = -1</m> and <m>x=3</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        The average rate of change is, by definition,
        <me>
          \frac{\text{ change in \(y\)-values } }{\text{ change in \(x\)-values } }
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        In this case that means
        <md>
          <mrow>\frac{f(3) - f(-1)}{3 - (-1)} \amp = \frac{4(9) - 2 - (4(1) - 2)}{4}</mrow>

        <dollar />20,000,000 to <dollar />20,500,000.
