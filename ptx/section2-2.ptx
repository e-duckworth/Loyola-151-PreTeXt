    <statement>
      <p>
        For the two points <m>(1,2)</m> and <m>(-5,4)</m> what is the slope of the line connecting them?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        There are probably three useful ways to think about the slope
        <md>
          <mrow>m \amp  = \frac{\text{ rise } }{\text{ run } }</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = \frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>

      <p>
        Note that all three of these formulas say the same thing:
        <q>rise</q> really means <m>y_2-y_1</m>,
        i.e.<nbsp />how much did <m>y</m> change.
        Similarly, <q><m>\Delta y</m></q>
        is just shorthand notation for
        <q>change of <m>y</m></q>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The main things you have to watch out for in this kind of problem are: (1) make sure you put the <m>y</m>'s on top, (2) make sure you use the numbers in the same order on the top and bottom.
        Here's a picture of how the numbers should move into the correct places:

        Now we finish our calculation:
        <md>
          <mrow>m \amp  = \frac{4 - 2}{-5 - 1}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = \frac{\ 2\ }{-6}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = - \frac 13</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Find an equation of the line that passes through <m>(1,2)</m> and <m>(-5,4)</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        We'll start with the point-slope form of the equation of a line:
        <me>
          y  = m(x-x_0) + y_0\\
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        From Example 1, we know the slope already, <m>m = -\frac{1}{3}</m>.
        Then
        we can use either <m>(1,2)</m> or <m>(-5,4)</m> for the known point.
        We'll
        use <m>(1,2)</m>.
        <me>
          y = -\frac{1}{3}(x-1) +2
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        There's nothing wrong with leaving the equation like this,
        but most of
        us are more used to the slope-intercept form, so we can distribute the
        numbers and simplify:
        <md>
          <mrow>y \amp  = -\frac{1}{3}x + \frac{1}{3} + 2</mrow>
          <mrow>y  \amp  = -\frac{1}{3}x + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{6}{3}</mrow>
          <mrow>y  \amp  = -\frac{1}{3}x + \frac{7}{3}</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A cab company has an initial charge of
        <m>\dollar4.00</m> plus <m>\dollar2.20</m> per mile.
        Find a formula for the cab fare, <m>C</m>,
        in dollars, as a function of the number of miles, <m>m</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        There are three things to identify here:
        where do we put the <m>4.00</m>,
        where do we put the <m>2.20</m>,
        and which variables should we use?
      </p>

      <p>
        The <m>4.00</m> is the initial charge.
        The word <q>initial</q>
        means at the very beginning, in this case,
        before we start driving at all.
        This means it's the value when we've gone <m>0</m> miles,
        which is another way to say it's the <m>y</m>-intercept,
        or the vertical intercept.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <m>2.20</m> is a charge <em><nbsp />per<nbsp /></em>mile.
        The word <q>per</q> is a clue that this is the slope:
        slope is a ratio, and <q>per</q> always means ratio too.
      </p>

      <p>
        Putting these together we should have
        <me>
          \text{ something like } y = 2.20\times \text{ something like } x + 4.00
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        The correct somethings are <m>C</m> instead of <m>y</m> and <m>m</m> instead of <m>x</m>.
        I know it looks weird, but <q><m>m</m></q>
        is our variable here, not slope
        (since <m>m</m> looks so weird,
        that's why I wrote it out with words first,
        to make sure I got things in the right place).
        <me>
          C = 2.20m + 4
        </me>
      </p>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        ACME company has seen a decline in sales of their product.
        In 2010
        they sold 28.4 million, while in 2016 they sold 22.7 million.

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Find a formula for annual sales <m>S</m>, in millions of items,
              as a linear function of the years <m>t</m>, since 2010.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Predict the sales in 2019.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              We have two points of the line:
              <m>(0, 28.4)</m>, and <m>(6, 22.7)</m>, which gives us
              <me>
                m = \frac{22.7-28.4}{6-0} = \frac{-5.7}{6} = -0.95
              </me>
              Luckily,
        we were given the <m>y</m>-intercept of <m>28.4</m> so we have
              <me>
                S(t) = -0.95t + 28.4
              </me>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Use <m>t = 9</m> to get
              <me>
                S(9) = -0.95(9) + 28.4 = 19.85
              </me>
              Thus we predict sales of <m>19.85</m> million in the year 2019.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
