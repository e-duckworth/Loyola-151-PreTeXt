          <li>

              Conceptually, our answer to part (a) can be viewed as the slope
              of a line through <m>(0,0)</m> and <m>(10000,16000)</m>
              <me>
                m= \frac{16000-0}{10000-0}
              </me>
              So we can picture this slope by adding a line to the above figure:
              <image>
                <latex-image><![CDATA[\begin{tikzpicture}\draw[shift={(1.95,2.2)}]node{\includegraphics[width=3in]{s4-5prob2}};
                \draw[red,very thick](0,0)-- (2.15,2.75);\end{tikzpicture}]]></latex-image>
              </image>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              To minimize the average cost,
              we would look at different lines from the origin to points on the curve,
              and we would ask: Out of all such lines,
              which one has the smallest possible slope?
              Here I've drawn 4 of them, just to illustrate:
              <image> <latex-image><![CDATA[\begin{tikzpicture}\draw[shift={(1.95,2.2)}]node{\includegraphics[width=3in]{s4-5prob2}}; \draw[red,very thick](0,0)-- (1.5,2.5); \draw[red,very thick](0,0)-- (2.15,2.75); \draw[red,very thick](0,0)-- (2.75,3); \draw[red,very thick](0,0)-- (3.8,3.6);\end{tikzpicture}]]></latex-image> </image> The last one,
              that goes to something like <m>q=18,000</m>,
              is the least steep of all the lines we've added.
              In fact, it's the least steep one we <em>can</em> add.
              So that's about where the minimum of average cost occurs.
              This is really important:
              notice at the point
        <m>(q,C) = (18000, 20500)</m> we have that the red line,
              which represents the average cost,
              is tangent to <m>C(q)</m>, the total cost.
              Thus,
        at this point, the average cost equals the marginal cost.
              We'll return to this in a later example.

  </example>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The cost function is <m>C(q) = 1000 + 20q</m>.
        Find the marginal cost to produce the 200th unit and the average cost of producing 200 units.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        The marginal cost is simply the derivative
        <me>
          MC(q) = C'(q) = 20
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        In other words,
        marginal cost is constant, and so <m>MC(200)=20</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The average cost <m>C(200)/200</m>:
        <me>
          a(100) = \frac{C(200)}{200} = \frac{1000+20(200)}{200} = 25
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        In other words,
        the added cost of making one additional unit is about <dollar />20,
        but on average the items have cost <dollar />25 each.

              Explain this relationship both analytically and in words.

          <li>
            <p>
              Since <m>a(q)= \frac{C(q)}{q}</m> we can turn this around and say
              <m>C(q) = a(q)\times q</m>.
              This gives
              <me>
                C(q) = 0.01q^3 - 0.6q^2 + 13q
              </me>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              There are two derivatives here:
              <m>MC</m> equals the derivative of
              <m>C(q)</m>,
              but to minimize <m>MC</m> we should take the derivative of <m>MC</m>
              and set this equal to <m>0</m>:
              <md>
                <mrow>MC \amp  = 0.03q^2 - 1.2q + 13</mrow>
                <mrow>MC' \amp  = 0.06q-1.2</mrow>
                <mrow>0.06q-1.2 \amp  = 0</mrow>
                <mrow>q \amp  = 1.2/0.06</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp  = 20</mrow>
              </md>
              Since <m>MC</m> is a parabola opening upward, we know that its only
              critical point is a minimum.
              To find out what this minimum is, we
              plug <m>q = 20</m> into the formula for <m>MC</m> (we plug it into MC because
              that is the function we are finding the minimum of).
              We get
              <m>MC(20) = 1</m> and so
              <me>
                \text{ Global Minimum: }   MC= \dollar1\text{ when } q=20
              </me>
              On a practical level, it means that when we make <m>20</m> items, we are
              operating at peak efficiency in the sense that each additional item
              only has an added cost of <dollar />1 per item.

          <li>
            <p>
              We will learn in this problem that there are two ways to
              minimize average cost:
        find a critical point of <m>a(q)</m> directly, or
              compare <m>a(q)</m> to <m>MC(q)</m> (we did this earlier on graphs).

              Here's how it looks to find the critical point of <m>a(q)</m> directly:
              <md>
                <mrow>a(q) \amp  = 0.01q^2 - 0.6q + 13</mrow>
                <mrow>a'(q) \amp  = 0.02q - 0.6</mrow>
                <mrow>0.02q - 0.6 \amp  = 0</mrow>
                <mrow>q \amp  = \frac{0.6}{0.02} = 30</mrow>
              </md>
              Because <m>a(q)</m> is a parabola opening upward,
        this critical point is
              a minimum.

              The average cost at this point is
              <me>
                a(30) = 0.01(30^2)-0.6(30)+13 = \dollar4 \text{ per item }
              </me>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              We simply plug in <m>q=30</m> to our formula above for MC
              <me>
                MC(30) = 0.03(30^2) -1.2(30)+13 = \dollar4 \text{ per item }
              </me>
              This is the same as our answer to part (c).
              We saw in an earlier
              example, using graphs,
        that average cost should be minimized when
              <m>MC = a(q)</m>, and that's the same thing we found just now.
              Here's the
              <q>analytical</q> reason.
              What that means is that we will take the
              derivative of <m>a(q)</m>,
        and set this equal to <m>0</m>,
              using only general
              formulas:
              <md>
                <mrow>a(q) \amp  = \frac{C(q)}{q}</mrow>
                <mrow>a'(q) \amp  = \frac{C'(q) \times q - C(q)\times 1}{q^2}</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{qC'(q) - C(q)}{q^2} \amp  = 0</mrow>
                <mrow>qC'(q) - C(q) \amp  = 0</mrow>
                <mrow>qC'(q) \amp  = C(q)</mrow>
                <mrow>C'(q) \amp  = \frac{C(q)}{q}</mrow>
                <mrow>MC \amp  = a(q)</mrow>
              </md>
              This gives us the following very useful fact
              \fbox{<em>average cost has a critical point when </em>
              <m>MC(q) = a(q)</m>}
              This should make sense on a practical level as well,
        using only words
              that someone could understand without calculus.
              Say you want to
              minimize average cost (which you usually do).
              If at some production
              level,
        each item you make costs more than your average, then you
              should cut back, because you're just increasing the average cost.
              On
              the other hand,
              if at some production level, each item you make costs
              less than your average,
        then you should make more, because you're
              lowering your average cost.
              When should you stay put, at the current
              production level?
              When each item costs the same as the average cost.
