  <title>Product and Quotient Rules</title>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Use the Product Rule to differentiate <m>y = x^2 e^{5x-3}</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        When you are first learning the product rule, you may need to take a
        couple of extra steps to keep the notation straight: (1) Write the
        product rule formula on your paper, right in your solution.
        If you
        write this every time, I promise that you'll be able to remember it
        better, and you'll be able to use it better. (2) Label the parts of
        the function with <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>,
        then find <m>f'</m> and <m>g'</m> and then put
        the parts together where they go in the product rule.
        <md>
          <mrow>(fg)' \amp  = f'\cdot g + f\cdot g'</mrow>
          <mrow>f     \amp  = x^2</mrow>
          <mrow>g     \amp  = e^{5x-3}</mrow>
          <mrow>f'    \amp  = 2x</mrow>
          <mrow>g'    \amp  = e^{(\text{ stuff } )}\cdot (\text{ stuff } )'</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = e^{5x-3}(5)</mrow>
          <mrow>y'    \amp  = f'\cdot g + f\cdot g'</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = 2x \cdot e^{5x-3} + x^2 \cdot e^{5x-3}(5)</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>

        It's not really necessary to do anything else to this answer:
        it's not going to simplify much,
        and we weren't asked to factor it or anything.
        It is traditional to put that last <q>5</q>
        in front of the <m>x^2</m>, but it's not mandatory.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let me show you how you might solve this problem if you've been doing
        product rules for a while.
        In that case, you might not label <m>f</m> and
        <m>g</m> and <m>f'</m> and <m>g'</m>.
        You might just identify them in your head, and
        say the following words to yourself as you go: <q>derivative of the
        1st, times the second, plus the 1st times the derivative of the
        second.</q>
        <me>
          \underbrace{2x}_{\rotatebox{-90}{deriv. of 1st}}
          \underbrace{\cdot \,e^{5x-3}}_{\rotatebox{-90}{times 2nd}} 
          +
          \underbrace{x^2}_{\rotatebox{-90}{1st}}
          \underbrace{\cdot \,e^{5x-3}(5)}_{\rotatebox{-90}{times deriv of 2nd}}
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        That may seem like a lot to keep track of, or do in your head,
        but if you just write and say one part at a time, it's not so bad.
        In any case,
        do not feel like you should try to do more in your head;
        feel free to label everything and arrange all the parts like we did in our first solution above.
        Just know, that if you want to,
        you can start to label less as you go.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Find the derivatives of the following:

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>y = x^3(2x-7)^4</m>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>y = 3t^4 \, \ln(t)</m>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Both of these involve the Product Rule.
      </p>

      <p>
        For (a), the first is <m>x^3</m> and the second is <m>(2x-7)^4</m>.
        Notice that
        finding the derivative of the second will involve the Chain Rule.
        <md>
          <mrow>y  \amp  = \big[x^3\big] \ \big[(2x-7)^4\big]</mrow>
          <mrow>y' \amp  = \big[x^3\big]' \ (2x-7)^4 + x^3\ \big[(2x-7)^4\big]'</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = \big[2x^2\big](2x-7)^4 + x^3\big[4(2x-7)^3(2)\big]</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = 2x^2(2x-7)^4 + 8x^3(2x-7)^3</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>

      <p>
        Again, you probably shouldn't try to
        <q>simplify</q> any farther here.
        We've taken the derivative, and we're done with that;
        unless there's a reason to factor it, just stop.
      </p>

      <p>
        For (b), in addition to the Power Rule and Product Rule,
        we need to
        remember that <m>\ddt\ln(t) = \frac{1}{t}</m>.
        <md>
          <mrow>y \amp  = \big[3t^4\big]\,\big[\ln(t)\big]</mrow>
          <mrow>y' \amp  = \big[3t^4\big]'\ln(t) + 3t^4\big[\ln(t)\big]'</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = 12t^3\ln(t) + 3t^4\, \frac{1}{t}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = 12t^3\ln(t) + 3t^3</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Use the Quotient Rule to differentiate <m>y = \frac{4t+5}{2-3t^2}</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        When you are first learning the Quotient Rule, you may need to take
        a couple of extra steps to keep the notation straight: (1) Write the
        Quotient Rule formula on your paper, right in your solution.
        If you
        write this every time, I promise that you'll be able to remember it
        better, and you'll be able to use it better. (2) Label the parts of
        the function with <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>,
        then find <m>f'</m> and <m>g'</m> and then put
        the parts together where they go in the Quotient Rule.
        <md>
          <mrow>\left(\frac{f}{g}\right)' \amp  = \frac{f'\cdot g - f\cdot g'}{(g)^2}</mrow>
          <mrow>f \amp  = 4t+5</mrow>
          <mrow>g \amp  = 2-3t^2</mrow>
          <mrow>f' \amp  = 4</mrow>
          <mrow>g' \amp  = -6t</mrow>
          <mrow>\frac{f'\cdot g - f\cdot g'}{g^2} \amp  = \frac{(4)(2-3t^2)-(4t+5)(-6t)}{(2-3t^2)^2}</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>

      <p>
        As before, just leave it alone and don't try to simplify,
        unless you've been asked to,
        or if there's a reason to.
        In other words,
        <em>simplify at your own risk</em>. (In case you want to practice,
        see if you can get <m>\frac{12t^2+30t + 8}{\left(2-3t^2\right)^2}</m> .)
      </p>

      <p>
        We can also learn to take the quotient rule without labelling
        everything, just like we talked about with the Product Rule.
        Here's
        how it looks.
        Say the following words to yourself as you write things
        down: <q>derivative of the top,
        times the bottom, minus the top, times
        the derivative of the bottom,
        all over the bottom squared.</q>
        <me>
          \frac{
          \overbrace{(4)}^{\rotatebox{-90}{deriv top}}
          \overbrace{(2-3t^2)}^{\rotatebox{-90}{times bottom}}
          -
          \overbrace{(4t+5)}^{\rotatebox{-90}{top}}
          \overbrace{(-6t)}^{\rotatebox{-90}{times deriv bottom}}
          }
          {
          \underbrace{(2-3t^2)^2}_{\text{ bottom squared } }
          }
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        There's a rhyming mnemonic for this as well:
        <q>low d-hi minus hi d-low, over the bottom squared, and away we go!</q>.
        Here, <q>low d-hi</q>
        means derivative of the top (d-hi) times the bottom, etc.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>f(x) = \frac{e^x}{2x+e^x}</m>.

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Find <m>f'(x)</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Find the equation of the tangent line at <m>x = 0</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        For part (a),
        we need to find <m>f'(x)</m> (using the Quotient Rule):
        <md>
          <mrow>\left(\frac{f}{g}\right)' \amp  = \frac{f'\cdot g - f\cdot g'}{(g)^2}</mrow>
          <mrow>f'(x) \amp  = \frac{e^x(2x+e^x) - e^x(2+e^x)}{(2x+e^x)^2}</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>

      <p>
        Note that we're using <m>f</m> differently in the second line than in the first one.
        That's one reason we have to understand the Product Rule and Quotient Rule as more than just moving letters around:
        we need to understand that in a certain place it's the derivative of the top,
        not just the letter <m>f'</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        For part (b), we'll fill in
        (as always)
        the point-slope equation of a line:
        <md>
          <mrow>y \amp  = m(x-x_0)+y_0</mrow>
          <mrow>x_0 \amp  = 0  \text{ given above }</mrow>
          <mrow>y_0 \amp  = f(0)</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = \frac{e^0}{0 + e^0}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = 1</mrow>
          <mrow>m \amp  = f'(0)</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = \frac{e^0(0+e^0) - e^0(2+e^0)}{(0 + e^0)^2}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = \frac{1(1) - 1(3)}{1^2}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = -2</mrow>
          <mrow>y \amp  = -2(x-0)+1</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = -2x+1</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>

      <p>
        They didn't ask us for it, but just for kicks,
        here's a graph of <m>f(x)</m> and the tangent line,
        just to show that we got it right:
