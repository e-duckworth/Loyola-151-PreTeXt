    <title>Problem 7</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Using the figure below (Figure 5.36 in the text), decide whether
        each of the following definite integrals is positive or negative.

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>\int_{-5}^{-4} f(x)\,dx</m>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>\int_{-4}^{1} f(x)\,dx</m>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>\int_{1}^{3} f(x)\,dx</m>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>\int_{-5}^{3} f(x)\,dx</m>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

    <solution>

        The main idea of this example is simply to translate integrals into net area.
        So, <m>\int_{-5}^{-4} f(x)\dx</m> is the net area,
        between <m>f(x)</m> and the <m>x</m>-axis,
        from <m>x=-5</m> to <m>x=-4</m>.
        We can do some parts of this problem without coloring anything in.
        For instance, in part (a),
        the graph of <m>f(x)</m> is entirely below the <m>x</m>-axis,
        and therefore the integral is negative.

        But, sooner or later it's useful to have different parts shaded in,
        so I'll go ahead and do that

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\int_{-5}^{-4}f(x)\dx</m> is area below the <m>x</m>-axis,
            as labeled above, so it's negative.
          </p>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\int_{-4}^1 f(x)\dx</m> is positive.

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\int_1^3 f(x)\dx = A_2 - A_1</m>.
            It's pretty easy to see that <m>A_1</m> is bigger,
            and so this integral, i.e.<nbsp />the net area, is negative.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\int_{-5}^3 f(x)\dx =</m> (a) + (b) + (c).
            Although (a) and (c) are negative,
            it's pretty easy to see that (b) is larger than both (a) and (c) combined (actually,
            to be more accurate I should say that (b) is larger than both the absolute values of (a) and (c) combined ).
            So, the net result is positive.

        This example is similar to the previous example,
        the only difference is that in the last example we could just estimate what was positive and what was negative,
        but here we can calculate the exact integrals using basic geometric formulas for area.
        We'll start by dividing the regions,
        shading them and labeling them.
