              In the graph below I've marked, by hand,
              two line segments on the curve,
              i.e.<nbsp />two secant lines.
              One goes from <m>x=0</m> to <m>x=3</m>,
              and the other goes from <m>x=3</m> to <m>x=5</m> <image width="56%" source="images/" /> To compare the average rates of change,
              you should look at the slope of each line segment.
              Since the one from <m>x=0</m> to <m>x=3</m> is steeper,
              it has a greater slope,
              and therefore the average rate of change is greater from <m>x=0</m> to <m>x=3</m>.

          <li>

              In the graph below I've marked,
              by hand, two tangent lines.
              One is tangent at <m>x=1</m> and the other is tangent at <m>x=4</m>. <image width="56%" source="images/" /> To compare the instantaneous rates of change,
              you should look at the slope of the tangent lines.
              Since the one at <m>x=1</m> is steeper, it has a greater slope,
              and therefore the instantaneous rate of change is greater at <m>x=1</m>.

                \frac{\text{ units of \(y\) } }{\text{ units of \(x\) } }
              </me>

      <p>
        We'll justify below the following answers:
        <me>
          \begin{array}{c|c}\hline
          \text{ Slope }  \amp   \text{ Point }  \\ \hline
          -3  \amp  F     \\ \hline
          -1  \amp  C     \\ \hline
          0   \amp  E     \\ \hline
          1/2 \amp  A     \\ \hline
          1   \amp  B     \\ \hline
          2   \amp  D     \\ \hline
          \end{array}
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's start by thinking about which point has negative slope:
        only two points are marked where the graph is going down:
        <m>C</m> and <m>F</m>.
        Which one is going down more steeply?
        You should be able to see that it's <m>F</m>.
        So, given the choice of two negative slopes in the table,
        <m>-3</m> and <m>-1</m>,
        we should choose <m>F</m> to have the slope that's more negative: <m>F \to -3</m>.
        Then we must have <m>C\to -1</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now let's think about which point has <m>0</m> slope:
        this should be where the tangent line is perfectly horizontal.
        There's only one point where this happens: <m>E</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, let's look at three remaining points,
        where the slope is positive.
        We can order them by how steep the graph is: It's steepest at <m>D</m>,
        then next steepest at <m>B</m>,
        and least steep at <m>A</m>.
        This means that <m>D\to 2</m>,
        <m>B\to 1</m>, and <m>A\to 1/2</m>.
      </p>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose we drop a penny from the roof of a very tall building.
        Then
        the distance fallen is given by
        <me>
          s(t) = 4.9t^2
        </me>,
        where <m>s</m> is measured in meters,
        and <m>t</m> is the number of seconds
        since the penny has been dropped.

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Find the average velocity from <m>t=0</m> to <m>t=7</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Estimate the instantaneous velocity at <m>t=7</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <md>
                <mrow>\text{ average velocity }  \amp  = \frac{\text{ distance traveled } }{\text{ time elapsed } }</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp  = \frac{s(7) - s(0)} {7-0}</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp  = \frac{4.9(7^2)-0}{7}</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp  = \unitfrac[34.3]{m}{s}</mrow>
              </md>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              To estimate the instantaneous velocity we find the average velocity over
              shorter and shorter time intervals around <m>t = 7</m> seconds.
              In other
              words, we will calculate this quantity
              <me>
                \frac{s(t) - s(7)} {t-7} = \frac{4.9(t^2)-4.9(7^2)}{t-7}
              </me>
              for values of <m>t</m> that are close to <m>7</m>.  

              The best way to get a range of values like this is to make a table,
              either in your calculator, or in a spreadsheet.
              <me>
                \begin{array}{c|c}
                \text{ \(t\)-value (the one not equal to \(7\)) }  \amp  \text{ average velocity from \(t\) to \(7\) }  \\
                \amp  = \frac{s(t)-s(7)}{t-7}                 \\ \hline
                6                       \amp  63.7                                    \\
                6.9                     \amp  68.11                                   \\
                6.99                    \amp  68.551                                  \\
                6.999                   \amp  68.595                                  \\
                7.001                   \amp  68.605                                  \\

                \end{array}
              </me>
              Once we have this information,
              we should look just around the rows
              that have <m>t</m> as close to <m>7</m> as possible,
              in this case, those are the
              rows with <m>6.999</m> and <m>7.001</m>.
              In those rows, the velocity is very
              close to <m>68.6</m>, and so that's our guess:
              <me>
                \text{ Instantaneous velocity at \(t=7\) is approximately: } 
                \unitfrac[68.6]{m}{s}
              </me>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Using a calculator or an equivalent app,
        estimate <m>f'(1)</m> for <m>f(x) = 3x^2</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        By definition we have
        <me>
          f'(1) = \lim_{x \to 1}\frac{f(x) - f(1)}{x-1}
        </me>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The way to estimate this is to calculate
        <m>\frac{f(x)-f(1)}{x-1}</m> for more than one value of <m>x</m>,
        using values that are close to <m>1</m>.
      </p>
