              The cost, <m>C</m>, of a steak, in dollars,

              An employee's pay, <m>P</m>, in dollars,

    <title>Problem 6</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        An economist is interested in how the price of a certain item
        affects its sales.
        At a price of <m>\dollarp</m>,
        a quantity, <m>q</m>, of the item
        is sold.
        If <m>q = f(p)</m>, explain the meaning of each of the following
        statements:

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>f(150) = 2000</m>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>f'(150) = -25</m>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              In problems like these,
              the best way to <q>explain the meaning</q> is to write a complete,
              correct, English sentence that uses the least amount of technical jargon as possible.
              In this case, here are some examples:
              <q>When the price is <dollar />150,
              there were 2000 items sold.</q>
              <q>If we price it at <dollar />150,
              then we'll sell 2000 items.</q>
              <q>A price of <dollar />150 leads to sales of 2000.</q>
              <q>We'll sell 2000 items at a price of <dollar />150.</q>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              It may help here to practice writing this in Leibniz notation:
              <me>
                \deriv{q}{p}\eval_{p=150}=-25
              </me>
              The reason this notation is useful is that it reminds us that the
              derivative is a rate of change,
              and which units are on top.
              Thus,
              we can see that the units are
        <q>items per dollar</q> and the rate of
              change is <m>-25</m>.
              As before, the best thing to do is to write this
              information down in a complete,
              correct, English sentence:

              <sidebyside>
                <q>If the price changes to <dollar />151,
              we can expect to sell about <m>25</m>
                fewer items.</q>


                <q>At the price of <dollar />150,
              an increase of <dollar />1 will cause the number of
                items sold to decrease by <dollar />25.</q>
              </sidebyside>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The cost, <m>C</m>
        (in dollars),
        to produce <m>\ell</m> liters of a chemical
        can be expressed as <m>C = f(\ell)</m>.
        Using units, explain the meaning
        of the following statements in terms of the chemical:

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>f(350)=1750</m>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>f'(350)=9</m>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              This means that it costs <dollar />1750 to produce 350 liters of chemical.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              This means it will cost about <dollar />1759 to produce 351 gallons.
            </p>
          </li>

      </p>

              Here are some of the values we look at for the difference
              quotient:
              <me>
                \begin{array}{c|c}
                \text{ 2nd \(x\)-value }  \amp  \dfrac{2\ln(x)-2\ln(1)}{x-1}\\ \hline
                0.5000 \amp  2.7726 \\
                0.9000 \amp  2.1072 \\
                0.9900 \amp  2.0101 \\
                0.9990 \amp  2.0010 \\
                0.9999 \amp  2.0001 \\
                1.0001     \amp  1.9999 \\
                1.0010     \amp  1.9990 \\
                1.0100     \amp  1.9901 \\
                1.1000     \amp  1.9062 \\
                1.5000     \amp  1.6219
                \end{array}
              </me>
              From this table, we estimate that <m>f'(1) = 2</m>.
              Using this, the tangent line at
              <md>
                <mrow>y \amp  = m(x-x_0) + y_0</mrow>
                <mrow>y \amp  2(x-1)</mrow>
              </md>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              The basic idea here is that we can use the tangent line to
              approximate values on the original graph.
              Thus
              <me>
                f(1.01) \approx y(1.01)
              </me>
              where <m>f(x) = 2\ln(x)</m> and <m>y(x) = 2(x-1)</m>.
              Using this, we have
              <md>
                <mrow>f(1.01) \amp  \approx 2(1.01-1) = 0.02</mrow>
                <mrow>f(1.001) \amp  \approx 2(1.001-1) = 0.002</mrow>
              </md>
              (As a way to double check these answers,
              my calculator says <m>\ln(1.01)
              = 0.009950330</m> and <m>\ln(1.001) = 0.000999500</m>.
              Our estimates are
              <em>very</em> close to these answers.)

              To see why this sort of approximation might be useful,
              given the
              examples we are working with,
              you have to use your imagination a
              little bit.
              You need to imagine a function that we <em>don't</em> know
              much about.
              For instance, the exact amount of the total national debt
              as a function of,
              <m>t</m>, or the amount of fuel consumption for a truck as
              function of its cargo weight, <m>w</m>.
              In each case, we don't know a
              formula for the function.
              But we might know what it's current value
              is, and how much that value is changing.
              Using this, we could
              estimate what it's value would be tomorrow, or with a slight increase
              in weight.

    <statement>
      <p>
        The area of Brazil's rain forest,
        <m>R = f(t)</m>, in million acres, is a
        function of the number of years, <m>t</m>, since 2000.

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Interpret <m>f(9) = 740</m> and
              <m>f'(9) = -2.7</m> in terms of Brazil's rain forests.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Find and interpret the relative rate of change of <m>f(t)</m> when <m>t = 9</m>.

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>f(9) = 740</m> tells us that in 2009,
              the area of Brazil's rain forest was 740 million acres.
              The formula <m>f'(9) = -2.7</m> tells us that in 2009,
              the area of the rain forest is decreasing by about 2.7 million acres per year.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <me>
                \text{ Relative rate of change in 2009 }  = \frac{f'(9)}{f(9)} =
                \frac{-2.7}{740} \approx -0.00365
              </me>
              Thus in 2009, the rain forests are shrinking at a rate of about
              <m>0.365\%</m> per year.

    <title>Problem 50(b*)</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The world population in billions is predicted to be approximately
        <m>P = 7.1e^{0.011t}</m> where <m>t</m> is in years since 2013.
        Estimate the relative rate of change of population in 2018 using this model and <m>\Delta t = 0.1</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        By definition,
        <me>
          \text{ Relative change in 2018 }  = \frac{P'(5)}{P(5)}
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        But to use this we first need to find <m>P'(5)</m>.
        We don't know the
        shortcut formula for this yet, so we will estimate it.
        Recall that
        <me>
          P'(5) = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{P(5 + \Delta t) - P(5)}{\Delta t}
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        We use this with <m>\Delta t=0.1</m> to estimate <m>P'(5)</m>:
        <me>
          P'(5) \approx \frac{P(5.1) - P(5)}{0.1} \approx 0.08256
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        Now we can finish this problem:
        <me>
          \text{ Relative rate of change in 2018 }  \approx \frac{0.08256}{P(5)}
          \approx 0.0122858
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        Another way to put this is that the relative rate of change in <m>2018</m> is approximately <m>1.2286 \%</m> per year.
