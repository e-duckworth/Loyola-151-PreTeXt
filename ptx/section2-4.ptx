    <statement>
      <p>
        A company producing jigsaw puzzles has fixed costs of <dollar />6000 and
        variable costs of <dollar />2 per puzzle.
        The company sells the puzzles for <dollar />5
        each.

              Find formulas for the cost function,

              The graph is shown below
              <image width="56%" source="images/" />
              It appears from the graph that the break-even point is about
              <m>q=2000</m>, and this is easy to verify algebraically:
              <md>
                <mrow>C \amp  = R</mrow>
                <mrow>6000 + 2q \amp  = 5q</mrow>
                <mrow>6000 \amp  = 3q</mrow>
                <mrow>q \amp  = 2000  \checkmark</mrow>

          <li>
            <p>
              The marginal cost is <dollar />2 per puzzle,
              the cost of making one additional puzzle.

    <title>Problem 32</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The demand curve for a product is given by <m>q=120,000-500p</m> and the
        supply curve is given by <m>q=1000p</m> for <m>0\le q \le 120,000</m>,
        where price
        is in dollars.

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              At a price of <dollar />100,
              what quantity are consumers willing to buy and what quantity are producers willing to supply?
              Will the market push prices up or down?
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Find the equilibrium price and quantity.
              Does your answer to part (a) support the observation that market forces tend to push prices closer to the equilibrium price?

      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <md>
                <mrow>quantity consumers are willing to buy
                \amp  = \text{ demand }</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp  = 120,000 - 500(100)</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp   = 70,000</mrow>
                <mrow>quantity producers are willing to make
                \amp  = \text{ supply }</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp  = 1000(100)</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp  = 100,000</mrow>
              </md>
              At a price of <dollar />100,
              the supply is larger than the demand, so some
              goods remain unsold and we expect the market to push prices down.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <md>
                <mrow>\text{ equilibrium is where supply }  \amp  = \text{ demand }</mrow>
                <mrow>120 000 - 500 p \amp  = 1000 p</mrow>
                <mrow>120 000 \amp  = 1500 p</mrow>
                <mrow>p  \amp  = \frac{1200}{15} = \frac{400}{5} = 80</mrow>
              </md>
              The equilibrium price is <m>\dollar80</m>,
              and the equilibrium quantity is
              <m>80,000</m>.  

              The market will push prices downward from <dollar />100, toward the
              equilibrium price of <dollar />80.
              This agrees with the conclusion to part
              (a) which says that prices will drop.
