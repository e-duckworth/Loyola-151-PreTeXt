        Although we have to do all four functions,
        we don't have to do them in order.
        So, we'll start with the simplest one: <hash />19.
      </p>

      <p>
        The function in <hash />19 is straight line,
        and it always has the same slope.
        We may not be able to tell exactly what this slope is:
        maybe <m>m=-2</m>, or <m>m=-3</m> or something like that.
        When we look at the graphs in Figure 2.25 we should not look at their slopes:
        we should look at their <m>y</m>-values.
        Which graph always has a constant <m>y</m>-value,
        of <m>y=-2</m> or <m>y=-3</m>?
        Graph IV. So, <hash />19 goes with graph IV.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now let's look at <hash />20.
        Around <m>x=0</m> this has a positive slope:
        maybe <m>m=1</m> or <m>m=2</m>.
        Around <m>x=2</m> this graph is horizontal, so <m>m=0</m>.
        Around <m>x=4</m> his has a negative slope:
        maybe <m>m=-1</m> or <m>m=-2</m>.
        When we look at the graphs in Figure 2.25 we should not look at their slopes:
        we should look at their <m>y</m>-values.
        Look at <m>x=0</m>, and <m>x=2</m> and <m>x=4</m>,
        which graph has <m>y=-1</m> or <m>y=-2</m>,
        then <m>y=0</m>, then <m>y=1</m> or <m>y=2</m>?
        Graph II. So, <hash />20 goes with graph II.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now let,s look at <hash />18.
        This one is more complicated, but
        paradoxically, this means we don't need to be as precise.
        There are
        two spots where the slope is <m>0</m>:
        at <m>x=-1</m> and <m>x=1</m>.
        To the far
        left the slope is negative;
        between <m>x=-1</m> and <m>x=1</m> the slope is
        positive, and to the far right the slope is negative again.
        When we
        look at the graphs in Figure 2.25 we should not look at their slopes:
        we should look at their <m>y</m>-values.
        Reading from left to right, we
        should look for <m>y</m>-values that are negative,
        <m>0</m>, positive, <m>0</m>,
        negative, or, to use shorthand:
        <me>
          -, 0, +, 0, -
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        Which graph has <m>y</m>-values that follow this pattern?
        Graph VIII.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, let's look at <hash />21.
        See if you can figure out why this function goes with graph VI.
