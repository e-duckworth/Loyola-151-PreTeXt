  <title>What is a Function?</title>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>f(x) = x^2</m>, then <m>f(5) = ?</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>g(t) = \sqrt{t^2 + 1}</m>,
            <m>g(0) = ?</m>, <m>g(-3) = ?</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>f(t+1) = ?</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>g(x + h) = ?</m>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              In the formula <q> <m>f(x)=x^2</m> </q>
              we simply replace each <q><m>x</m></q>
              with <m>5</m> to get
              <me>
                f(5) = 5^2
              </me>
              Maybe that's the best place to stop,
              because this problem isn't really
              about calculating <m>5^2</m> it's about how we combine <m>x^2</m> and <m>5</m>, which
              we've done.
              But I know the curiosity is killing you, so we can go to
              the next step and say:
              <me>
                f(5) = 5^2 = 25
              </me>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              With a little practice,
        you should be able to find <m>g(0)</m> in
              your head, but for now,
        let's write out every step:
              <md>
                <mrow>g(0) \amp  = \sqrt{0^2 + 1}</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp  = \sqrt{1}</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp  = 1</mrow>
              </md>
              For <m>g(-3)</m> the only real difference is that you should be careful
              about order of operations with the negative <m>3</m>.
              Note that whatever
              we plug in for <m>t</m> should be squared, including the negative:
              <md>
                <mrow>g(-3) \amp  = \sqrt{(-3)^2 + 1}</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp  = \sqrt{9+1}</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp  = \sqrt{10}</mrow>
              </md>
              We'll leave the answer in this form,
              because the point of this example
              <em>isn't</em> how to find the square root using our calculator.
              The
              point is do we know where to put the <m>-3</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              For <m>f(t+1)</m> it might help if we first write <m>f</m> without using
              <m>x</m>.
              Remember, <q><m>x</m></q>
              is just a letter we use to stand for
              something else.
              If you get too fixated on <m>x</m> you might miss how
              <m>f</m> is really defined,
        and therefore how to find <m>f(t+1)</m>.
              Here's a
              different way to write <m>f</m>:
              <me>
                f() = ()^2
              </me>
              Whatever you put into <m>()</m> on the left you should also put into
              <m>()^2</m> on the right:
              <me>
                f(t+1) = (t+1)^2
              </me>
              I'll stop there for (c) because the point isn't whether we can FOIL or
              expand <m>(t+1)^2</m>,
        the point is did we plug <m>t+1</m> in correctly.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              As in the last part, let's first write <m>g</m> without using the
              letter <m>t</m>,
              just using a blank space which we can plug stuff into:
              <me>
                g()=\sqrt{()^2+1}
              </me>
              Now, we should plug <m>x+h</m> into <m>()</m> on both the left and the
              right:
              <me>
                g(x+h)=\sqrt{(x+h)^2+1}
              </me>
              Again, I won't try to expand and rewrite that any,
        because it's not
              the point,
        and because in this problem it doesn't really help.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </solution>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The historic Senator Theater is the nearest movie theater to Loyola.
        Their ticket prices for adults (non-students) seeing a 3D movie are
        <dollar />13.50 for movies after 6 PM, <dollar />11 for a matinee (noon <mdash /> 6 PM),
        and <dollar />9 for an early bird show (before 11 AM).
        Write a piecewise
        function <m>P(t)</m> for the price of the ticket where <m>t</m> is the time of
        the showing.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Basically we're just taking the given information about pricing and
        times and arranging it using the notation for piecewise functions.
        We put the prices first, and then times second. (In general we put
        formulas first, and the conditions second.) In this case we get
        <me>
          P(t) = 
          \begin{cases}9 \amp  \text{ if } t\lt  11:00\\
          11 \amp  \text{ if } 12:00 \le t \le 18:00\\
          13.50 \amp  \text{ if } t> 18:00
          \end{cases}
        </me>

        Since July 1, 2016, the Maryland minimum wage is <dollar />8.75 per hour
        (FYI: it will increase to <dollar />9.25 on July 1, 2017).
        Suppose someone
        is able to make time and a half per hour of overtime (over 40
        hours).
        If <m>x</m> is the number of hours worked for this week and
        <m>f(x)</m> is the income function for (gross) income earned that week,
        answer the following:

        The domain is the set of all numbers that we can plug into our formula.
        When I say <q>we can plug in</q>
        I mean so that the result is defined, or calculate-able.
        The way we find the domain is to look for the numbers that are not in it,
        the numbers that make things undefined or un-calculate-able.
        In other words, we look for the problem spots.
      </p>

      <p>
        With algebraic functions like these there are only two possible
        kinds of problem spots: division by 0, and square roots of negative
        numbers.
        These are problems, and so these are not in the domain.

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              For <m>3x-5</m> are there any problem spots?
              Is there any number I
              could plug in that would lead to division by <m>0</m> or the square root
              of a negative number?
              No.
              There is no division, and there is no
              square root here.

              No problem spots means that all numbers are ok.
              Thus, the domain is
              all real numbers.
              We write this in two ways:
              <me>
                \begin{array}{ccc}
                \text{ interval notation }  \amp  \amp  \text{ inequalities } \\
                (-\infty,\infty)  \amp \amp  \infty \lt  x \lt  \infty
                \end{array}
              </me>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              For <m>\sqrt{x+5}</m> are there are problem spots?
              Is there any
              number I could plug in that would lead to division by <m>0</m> or the
              square root of a negative number?
              No for division, yes for the
              square root of a negative number.
              <md>
                <mrow>\sqrt{x+5} \amp  \text{ needs }</mrow>
                <mrow>x+5 \amp  \ge 0</mrow>
                <mrow>x \amp  \ge -5</mrow>
              </md>
              Again, these are the numbers that are ok,
              i.e.<nbsp />that are in the
              domain.

              As before, we write this in two ways:
              <me>
                \begin{array}{ccc}
                \text{ interval notation }  \amp  \amp  \text{ inequalities } \\
                (-5,\infty) \amp \amp   x \ge -5
                \end{array}
              </me>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              For <m>\frac 1x</m> are there are problem spots?
              Is there any number
              I could plug in that would lead to division by <m>0</m> or the square
              root of a negative number?
              No for square roots, yes for division.
              <md>
                <mrow>\frac 1x \amp  \text{ needs }</mrow>
                <mrow>x \amp  \ne 0</mrow>
              </md>
              Again, these are the numbers that are ok,
              i.e.<nbsp />that are in the domain. 

              As before, we write this in two ways:
              <me>
                \begin{array}{ccc}
                \text{ interval notation }  \amp  \amp  \text{ inequalities } \\
                (-\infty,0)\cup (0,\infty) \amp \amp  x \ne 0
                \end{array}
              </me>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              For <m>\frac {\sqrt{5-t}}{t+2}</m> are there are problem spots?
              Is
              there any number I could plug in that would lead to division by <m>0</m>
              or the square root of a negative number?
              Yes for both!
              <md>
                <mrow>\sqrt{5-t} \amp  \text{ needs }</mrow>
                <mrow>5-t  \amp  \ge 0</mrow>
                <mrow>5 \amp  \ge t</mrow>
                <mrow>t \amp  \le 5</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{\text{ something } }{t+2} \amp  \text{ needs }</mrow>
                <mrow>t+2 \amp  \ne 0</mrow>
                <mrow>t \amp  \ne -2</mrow>
              </md>
              Again, these are the numbers that are ok,
              i.e.<nbsp />that are in the domain. 

              We need both of these conditions to be true:
              <m>t\le 5</m> and <m>t\ne -2</m>.
              This is a good way to write the answer,
              but if we want to make it look
              like the other answers,
        then we can write this in two ways:
              <me>
                \begin{array}{ccc}
                \text{ interval notation }  \amp  \amp  \text{ inequalities } \\
                (-\infty,-2)\cup (-2,5) \amp   \amp  t \lt -2 \text{ or } -2 \lt  t \le 5
                \end{array}
              </me>
            </p>
