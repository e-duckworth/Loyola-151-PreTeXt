      Suppose you're looking at a demand curve.
      What does the point on the curve where <m>p=0</m> mean?
      What does the point where <m>q=0</m> mean?
    </p>

    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>C(q)</m> be the total cost of producing a quantity <m>q</m> of a
        certain product.
        See Figure below (Figure 4.52 in the text).

              Explain the economic significance

              Do you expect the graph of <m>C(q)</m> to look like this for all types of products?

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>C(0)</m> is the amount of the fixed costs before production.
              This would include costs of initial investments such as the building(s),
              equipment,
              etc. needed to begin production.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              The marginal cost decreases slowly,
              and then increases as quantity produced (<m>q</m>) increases.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Concave down implies decreasing marginal cost,
              while concave up implies increasing marginal cost.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Since the concavity of the graph is determined by <m>C''(q) = MC'(q)</m>,
              when the graph is concave up,
              that means <m>C''(q) = MC'(q)</m> is positive.
              Thus marginal cost (<m>MC</m>) is increasing when cost is concave up,
              and likewise marginal cost is decreasing when cost is concave down.
              From this we get an inflection point on the graph of cost will be when marginal cost changes from increasing to decreasing,
              or from decreasing to increasing.
              Thus an inflection point of the cost function is a point where marginal cost has a local or global extremum.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Because of volume pricing of supplies,
              etc., there are production levels in which the additional cost to produce more items
              (marginal cost)
              would decrease.
              But at some point,
              one would have to pay workers overtime, hire more workers,
              rent more storage space,
        add more delivery trucks, etc.
              Thus at some point the additional cost to produce more
              (marginal cost)
              will go up.

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A demand function is <m>p = 400-2q</m>,
        where <m>q</m> is the quantity of the
        good sold for price <m>\dollarp</m>.

          <li>
            <p>
              Compare with the change in total revenue when production changes from <m>q=10</m> to <m>q=11</m> using the revenue function to the approximation in change in revenue using <m>MR</m>.

    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Before we start, make sure you understand the basic formula
        <m>p=400-2q</m>.
        This means that we can plug in something like <m>q=100</m>
        and get the price, <m>p(100)</m>.
        Sometimes we do demand problems the
        other way around, so always stop and double check.

            <p>
              <md>
                <mrow>R(q) \amp  = (\text{ price } )(\#\text{ sold } )</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp  = [p(q)][q]</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp  = (400-2q)(q)</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp  = 400q-2q^2</mrow>
              </md>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <md>
                <mrow>MR \amp  = R'(q)</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp  = 400 - 4q</mrow>
                <mrow>MR(10) \amp  = 400+4(10)</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp  = 360</mrow>
              </md>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <md>
                <mrow>\Delta R \amp  = R(11) - R(10)</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp  = 400(11)-2(11^2) - \BigParens{400(10)-2(10^2)}</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp  = 4158 - 3800</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp  = 358</mrow>
              </md>
              The point of part (c) is that 358 is really close to 360, but it's
              actually much easier to calculate the 360.
              So, rather than calculate
              marginal revenue by plugging in two values of <m>q</m> that are next to
              each other, and subtracting,
              we should use the derivative.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The demand equation for a product is <m>p = 295 - 0.2q</m>.
        Write the revenue as a function of <m>q</m> and find the quantity that maximizes revenue.
        What price corresponds to this quantity?
        What is the total revenue at this price?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        We start by finding <m>R(q)</m>.
        <md>
          <mrow>R(q) \amp  = (\text{ price } )(\#\text{ sold } )</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = [p(q)][q]</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = (295 -0.2q)(q)</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = 259q-0.2q^2</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, as always,
        we take the derivative and set it equal to <m>0</m>
        <md>
          <mrow>R'(q) \amp  = 295 - 0.4 q</mrow>
          <mrow>295 - 0.4 q \amp  = 0</mrow>
          <mrow>q \amp  = \frac{295}{0.4}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  =  737.5</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>

      <p>
        This is a critical number.
        To verify that it's a maximum,
        note that the original function
        <m>R(q) = 295q-0.2q^2</m> is a parabola that opens downwards.
        Thus, the only critical point that it has is a maximum. (You can also pretty easily double check that the second derivative is negative,
        so again, it's a maximum.)
      </p>

      <p>
        To find the price that corresponds to this quantity we use the
        original function for <m>p</m>:
        <md>
          <mrow>p \amp  = 295 - 0.2 q</mrow>
          <mrow>p(737.5) \amp  = 295 - 0.2(737.5)</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = \dollar 147.5</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, we'll get the revenue that we expect at this quantity.
        We
        can calculate it in the simplest possible way: we've got <m>737.5</m>
        things, and each of them sells at a price of <m>\dollar147.5</m>,
        for a total of
        <me>
          737.5\times \dollar147.5 = \dollar108,781.25
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        We could also plug <m>737.5</m> directly into the formula for <m>R(q)</m>:
        <me>
          R(737.5) = 295(737.5) - 0.2 (737.5)^2 = 108,781.25

            Production of an item has fixed costs of
            <m>\dollar9,500</m> and variable costs of <m>\dollar175</m> per item.
            Express the cost, <m>C</m>, of producing <m>q</m> items.

            The relationship between price,

            Market research shows that <m>10,500</m> items are sold when the price is
            <m>\dollar280</m> and <m>13,000</m> items are sold when the price is <m>\dollar250</m>.
            Express <m>p</m> as a function of price <m>q</m>.

            How many items should the company produce to maximize profit? (Give your answer to the nearest integer.) What is the profit at that production level?
            What is the price charged at that production level?

            <p>
              Be very carefully!
              Some problems, many, use <m>q</m> as a function
              of <m>p</m>.
              But we are doing it the other way this time, we want <m>p</m>=
              stuff involving <m>q</m>.

              We solve this problem the same we solve every similar linear
              problem: use 2 points on the line:
              <m>(10500,280)</m> and <m>(13000,250)</m>
              so we can calculate <m>m</m>,
              and plug into the point-slope formula:
              <md>
                <mrow>p-p_0 \amp  = m(q-q_0)</mrow>
                <mrow>\text{ or } p \amp  = m(q-q_0)+p_0</mrow>
              </md>
              We can let <m>q_0=10500</m>,
              and <m>p_0=280</m>, and so all we have to do is
              calculate <m>m</m>:
              <md>
                <mrow>m \amp  = \frac{280-250}{10500-13000} = \frac{30}{-2500} = -\frac{3}{250}</mrow>

              Finding the maximum of profit can be done in two different ways:
              Finding the critical point of <m>P</m> or by setting <m>MR = MC</m>.
              Let's try
              <m>MR=MC</m> (recall that MC, the marginal cost,
        was given in the very
              first line of the problem):
              <md>
                <mrow>MR                    \amp  = MC</mrow>
                <mrow>-\frac{6}{250}q + 406 \amp  = 175</mrow>
                <mrow>-\frac{6}{250}q + 406 \amp  = 175</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{6}{250}q        \amp  = 231</mrow>
                <mrow>q                     \amp  = 231(250/6)</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp  = 9625</mrow>
              </md>
              Since <m>P</m> is a parabola opening downwards,
              we know this critical point
              is the vertex and a maximum.
              To find the actual profit, we should
              plug <m>q=9625</m> into <m>P</m> to get <m>P(9625) = 1102187.5</m> and to find the
              actual price we should use our formula in part <m>b</m> to get
              <m>p(9625) = \dollar290.5</m>.
              Now we can summarize everything we've found

    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose you are making something, say T-shirts,
        and you want to model how much revenue you'll bring in.
        You know the demand curve of your T-shirts,
        i.e. how many T-shirts you'll sell at a given price.
        You can write the demand curve in two ways, <m>q=Q(p)</m>,
        i.e. quantity sold depends on the price you set, or <m>p=P(q)</m>,
        i.e. the price you set should depend on how many you want to sell.
      </p>

      <p>
        Which do you think makes more sense:
        use <m>q=Q(p)</m> and write <m>R</m> as a function <m>p</m>,
        so <m>R(p)= p\times Q(p)</m>,
        or use <m>p=P(q)</m> and write <m>R</m> as a function of <m>q</m>,
        so <m>R(q) = P(q)\times q</m>?
